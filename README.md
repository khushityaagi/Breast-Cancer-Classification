# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification using Deep Learning

## Project Summary

Early detection of breast cancer significantly improves survival rates. This project explores the application of deep learning techniques to automatically classify breast tumor images into **benign** and **malignant** categories.

The primary goal was to design, train, and compare multiple state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to understand their effectiveness in medical image classification and identify the most reliable model for accurate diagnosis support.
